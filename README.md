Skip YouTube search results and launch videos instantly.<br><br>
A great extension to use if you are want to jump right to a video/song in youtube you
 frequently watch/hear without the intermediate hassle of clicking the first search result.
 This extension adds the functionality of I am feeling lucky button in google search to youtube.com, i.e redirects to first video in youtube search result. To use it click the I am feeling lucky button next to search button or press shift enter after typing your query in the search box.
